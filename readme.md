##Double Quote UK Keyboard Mapping for Windows

Why do keyboards not have a " assigned to a key that doesn't need to be pressed with a modifier?? As a developer, I use
the key often, but there isn't an obvious key to remove as such.

What this keyboard mapping will do, is make the Back Tick ` key the " instead.

The functionality of the Back Tick key is pushed down the keyboard modifier chain, so the three characters are not lost,
but do require some finger contortion skills, however, its far less stress on the fingers not having to Shift+2 anymore!
